      "challenges": "One of the main challenges was ensuring the application was both highly performant and scalable to handle a growing number of users. We needed to optimize database queries and implement efficient caching strategies without compromising data integrity.",
      "solution": "We implemented a combination of Django's built-in caching framework and optimized our database queries using `select_related` and `prefetch_related`. We also used Celery for handling asynchronous tasks, which significantly improved response times and overall performance."
